# dotfiles
some of my dot files and installation scripts for vim, tmux etc.
feel free to look around. i keep them here for easy up/down load to various machines.
use at your own risk.
these conf and installation scripts are for ubuntu and linux mint servers, desktops etc.
most of the config stuff is from around the web, nothing fancy here. just one stop location for automation.

end.
